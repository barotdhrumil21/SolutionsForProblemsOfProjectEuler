first we declare four lists for storing prime numbers 
in the first list the first number is initialized to 2
we declre a number (say init) initialized to 2 to loop through
then a for loop to loop till one million to find and store prime numbers
	within the for loop we increament number by 2 and we devide it by
		if number is 2 digits long then
			by every number numbers less then one third of that number in first list
			and if divided successfully, break the for loop
			if not then add it to first list
		if number is 3 or 4 digit long then 
			by every number number less than one tenth of that number in second list and first list
			and if divided successfully, break the for loop
			if not then add it to second list
		if number is 5 or 6 digit long then 
			by every number number less than one hundreth of that number in the third list and second list
			and if divided successfully, break the for loop
			if not then add it to third list
		/*
		we will never have seven digit long number because one million is upper bound
		if number is 7 digit long then 
			by every number number less than one thousandth of that number from fourth list and third list
			and if divided successfully, break the for loop 
			if not then add it to fourth list
